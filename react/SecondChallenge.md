### Second Challenge: Wallet Showcase Slider with Embla Carousel and MUI

#### Challenge Description

In this challenge, you'll create a wallet showcase slider using **Embla Carousel** integrated with **MUI (Material-UI)**. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to create a visually appealing and responsive wallet slider that allows users to scroll through different wallet options.

#### Requirements

1. **Set Up Embla Carousel:**
   - Integrate **Embla Carousel** into your React project.
   - Create a slider that displays multiple wallet cards horizontally.
   - The slider should support smooth scrolling, and snap to each wallet card.

2. **Create Wallet Card Components:**
   - Each wallet card should include:
     - Wallet Icon (use an appropriate placeholder image or icon)
     - Wallet Name
     - Wallet Balance
   - Use **MUI** components like `Card`, `CardMedia`, `CardContent`, and `Typography` for styling the wallet cards.

3. **Apply MUI Styling:**
   - Use **MUI’s Grid** system to ensure each wallet card is evenly spaced and aligned within the slider.
   - Style the cards using **MUI’s makeStyles** or **styled-components** to create a sleek and modern design, including:
     - Rounded corners
     - Subtle shadows
     - Hover effect that highlights the selected wallet card

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure that the wallet slider is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
   - Use MUI’s responsive utilities to manage the size and spacing of the wallet cards.

5. **Interactivity:**

   - Ensure that the active wallet card is highlighted as the user scrolls through the slider.
