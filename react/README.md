# Senior React Project: Live Coding Session

## Project Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate a senior-level understanding of modern React development practices using TypeScript, MUI, Zustand, React Query, Zod, and React Hook Form. The live coding session will focus on building a fully functional, high-performance, and type-safe application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety to the project.
- **MUI (Material-UI)**: A popular React UI framework for creating sleek and responsive user interfaces.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React.
- **React Query**: A data-fetching library that simplifies server-state management in React.
- **React Hook Form**: A library for building flexible and efficient forms in React.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.

## Features

- **Type-Safe State Management**: Using Zustand for managing application state with TypeScript.
- **Data Fetching and Caching**: Leveraging React Query for efficient and optimized server-state management.
- **Form Handling**: Building forms with React Hook Form and ensuring data integrity with Zod for validation.
- **Responsive UI**: Utilizing MUI to create a visually appealing and mobile-friendly user interface.
- **Schema Validation**: Integrating Zod to ensure type-safe data structures throughout the application.
